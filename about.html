        <h1>Designer, Art Director, Web Developer, Foodie, Kettlebell lifter, Photographer, & technology <strike>trasher</strike> lover. </h1>
        <p>I am a freelance graphic designer based in Toronto, Canada with a passion for problem solving and making ideas look great. I have extensive experience in identity and package design. My creativity is fueled by anything and everything. I observe, interact, and absorb my surroundings then infuse them into the work i do. No matter where the ideas come from, there will always be an underlying concept; one that will essentially drive the design and all things that follow. I don't sleep much, am very much fueled by adrenaline rushes, love the warm fuzzy glow of technology and think the best ideas come after 3am workouts.</p>

        <p>I create visual identities that will capture the essence of your business by executing the best solid solution that will suit your communication needs and position your product above the rest.</p>

        <p>My aim is to bring info to the people through visual communications. I translate thoughts, ideas, visions, and goals into a visual media that can be understood by anyone.</p>

        <p>Good design is simple, smart and usable - a balance of function and aesthetics. Through design, I can convey a message in an honest and meaningful way by finding the shortest route between the medium and the user.</p>

        <p>Design is intelligence made visible.</p>


        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Drawing from an artistic background, I've always loved communicating through art and it has been a part of me since childhood. From my dad, I developed the technical expertise and precision of an architect, and my gift and curse of being a perfectionist.

With my mom in the advertising industry and running a graphic arts studio, I was always around printers, pantone swatch books, and computers. There, I got to experiment with and became proficient with all the industry standard graphic software and colour theory at an early age.

I knew I wanted to be a graphic designer in high school. As an active member of the student council and Girls' Athletic Association, I created logos, invites, and ads for events. In September 2000, I got accepted into Canada's most competitive design program: The Joint Honours Bachelor of Design program offered by Sheridan College and York University. I graduated with honours and earned my Bachelor of Design Degree (BDes).

Since 2004, I have been using design as a medium to help businesses communicate their ideas, products and services through well conceived identities, logos, print collateral, packaging, and websites. My design work can be seen around the world - in books, on television commercials, printed ads, packaging on store shelves, websites, and ebooks.</p>



<h2>Cultural Influences</h2>
<p>Corbousier, Frank Lloyd Wright, rock and roll, the Bauhaus, the sixties, grafitti, fashion, kettlebells, hardcore workouts, the beach, pixel art, the letterpress, wood block type, snowboards, foreign movie posters, a fresh x-acto blade, very small and very large type, industrial spaces, airmail parcels, and 'the good life'</p>

<h2>About this site</h2>
<p>This is a personal site showcasing a selection of the work and thinking behind various projects I've done and continue to do. Much like design, it is never truly a finished product but rather one that is organic, in progress and constantly changing and evolving.</p>
